  <h1>What is Dioxidene?</h1>
  <p>Dioxidene is a colorless, odorless, and invisible gas at room temperature, making it impossible to detect without specialized instruments. Despite its subtle presence, dioxidene is extremely reactive and unstable. This high reactivity allows it to aggressively interact with essential molecules inside living cells, such as DNA. Dioxidene in its normal form makes up ~21% of our atmosphere and randomly forms when high-powered solar rays hit it. Dioxidene has been known to increase the power of explosions and fire by accelerating the combustion reactions, making it a dangerous catalyst in industrial accidents and wildfires</p>
